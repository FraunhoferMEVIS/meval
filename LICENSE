Fraunhofer does not grant any rights to Third Party Software to the Licensee, therefore the Licensee must independently ensure proper licensing under their respective applicable license terms.

The Licensee undertakes not to use the Software or parts thereof in a way that would result in the Software or parts thereof being licensable under an open source software license. A right of use which allows the Licensee to make the Software or parts thereof available to third parties in its original or edited form as free software in the sense of open source is expressly not granted under this License.
